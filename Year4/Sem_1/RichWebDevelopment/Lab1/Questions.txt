Question: Explain what is meant by Rich Web Application Development. Distinguish it from traditional web development?

Answer: A rich web application is a web application where the client has most, if not all the responsibility
for implementing the presentation layer logic. Traditional webpages may rely more heavily on the server for
the presentation layer logic. Also, a traditional webpage mainly consists of text and possibly some pictures
and other static data. A rich web app on the other hand can deal with more complex functionality such as audio,
transitions, video etc.

Question: What is the Document Object Model? Explain, giving a couple of examples, how to interact with the DOM in Javascript?

Answer: The DOM or Document Object Model is an api for HTML and XML. It lays out a parent and sibling structure that can be
added to or deleted from. It also allows existing elements to be editing within the document itself. The DOM itself can be
accessed through various different languages such as Java, Javascript etc.

An example of the DOM would be as follows:

<html>
  <body>
    <h1> This is a page >/h1>
    <div id = "a">
      <p id = "b">This is text on the page</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

The HTML is taken and parsed by the browser and then translated into the DOM itself (will still look similar, if not the same
as the html). You can interact with it in Javascript as follows:

<script>
  var div = document.getElementById("a");
  var text = document.getElementById("b");
  var text1 = document.createElement('p');
  text1.innerHTML = "Added using the Javascript!";
  text.style.backgroundColor = "#000";
  text1.setAttribute('id','c');
  div.appendChild(text1);
</script>
