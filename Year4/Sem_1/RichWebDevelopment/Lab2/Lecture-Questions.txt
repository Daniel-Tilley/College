Question: What does it mean for a data structure to be described as a functor? Give a code example in Javascript in your explanation.

Answer: A functor is a data object that can hold elements of any data type which implements the map operation (a function).
The functor's map() function takes, as an argument, another function and calls that function for each element of the functor,
resulting in a new functor.

e.g

['123','456','789']
  .map(s => parseInt(s))
  .map(n => n / 10)

will output:

[12.3, 45.6, 78.9]


Question: Describe how the flexbox model works in CSS.

Answer: The flex box model is a layout mode in CSS 3. By using the flexbox model, a developer can ensure that elements behave in
a predictable manner when the size of a screen varies from one device to another. This is achieved by creating a container
and placing all other elements within in, Each element within the container is assigned a set of rules for its width, height
and order and the browser works to scale the items accordingly.
