# OOP-Assignment #
2nd Year OOP assignment Semester 1

The idea for my assignment is to create a program that takes data from this years Tour De France (2015) through CSV Files and then plots the 
data on different charts. Some examples of DATA I have already loaded are:

* General Classification,
* Entrants, 
* Drop outs per stage, 
* Average Speed Per stage,
* Distance per stage,
* Stage Type

I use tables in my sketch to load the data in as I feel as though this is a very powerful and easy way to load in the data.

The sketch is menu driven (as seen below) and requires users inputs from the keyboard to traverse the menu. I intended on using ControlP5
buttons for my sketch, however, when I loaded them into the sketch, they made the sketch blurry so I decided against it.

There are 3 graphs to shoose from and within each graph, there is a number of datasets you can choose to display by clicking anywhere on 
the graphs. The graphs included are:

* Line Graph
* Bar Chart
* Scatter Graph

I also look correlation between certain things such as the number of drop outs per stage in relation to the highest gradient for
that stage and also distance in relation to the average speed.

All data has been taken from:

* http://www.letour.com/le-tour/2015
* http://www.dimensiondata.com/
